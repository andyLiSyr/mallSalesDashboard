# Mall Sales Excel Dashboard

I wanted to create a sales dashboard in Excel for fun. I went on Kaggle and found a CSV dataset on sales data on a series of malls in Istanbul, Turkey.

## Approach

- Formatted dates and filtered out rows of unnecessary data from the dataset using Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook
- Imported the CSV dataset with formatted dates to Excel and transformed it into an Excel sheet
- Performed further data cleaning in Excel by checking for duplicate rows and null/outlier values for each column
- Feature engineered new columns of data like age group, revenue, dollars in USD using existing columns
- Created pivot tables and pivot charts using the finalized Excel sheet
- Created the dashboard by piecing together pivot charts/tables and used slicers for interactive filtering
